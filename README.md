# Terraform Resource Finder

## Requirements

1. Node 22.9.0 (`nvm use`)
2. TSX: `npm install -g tsx`

## Overview

This script is intended to be used with terraform state files (tfstate.state)
that are generated by our various projects. It will locate the resources
specified in the `resource_to_locate` variable against the location specified in
the `path_to_states` variable.

The `resources_to_locate` variable should be an array of strings and the values
of each string should use the terraform format for identifying aws resources,
for example:

```
const resources_to_locate: string[] = [
  "aws_subnet",
  "aws_default_network_acl",
  "aws_network_acl",
  "aws_vpc",
  "aws_internet_gateway",
  "aws_default_route_table",
  "aws_backup_plan",
  "aws_backup_vault",
  "aws_default_security_group",
  "aws_route_table",
];
```

The `path_to_states` variable should point to the directory on your local
machine where you downloaded state files too.

## Example usage:

`npx tsx src/index.ts` is the most common use case.

`npx tsx src/index.ts > log.log` will write the results to the log.log file
(this is useful when there are a lot of results).
